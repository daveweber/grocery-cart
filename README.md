You can add items to the cart, either by quantity or by weight.

You can remove items from the cart as well.

Discounts can be set up, either to add bonus items or to discount existing items. Removed items will also void the discount.

When checking out, you'll be able to see a historically accurate list of transactions, and the total cost of the cart.
